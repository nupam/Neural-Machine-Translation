Neural Machine Translation

This translation model has been heavily inspired from the teachings and assignments of coursera, Deeplearing.ai, course on Deep learning specialisation. 

The included utility file, nmt_utils has been include "as is" as provide in the course.

A Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model has been built to translate human readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25"). You will do this using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence to sequence models. 

Requires keras
