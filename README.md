Neural Machine Translation

This translation model has been heavily inspired from the teachings and assignments of coursera, Deeplearing.ai, course on Deep learning specialisation. 

The included utility file, nmt_utils has been include "as is" as provide in the course, it contains utilities to load the datasetst.

LSTM cells are used to build the RNN Model. At first a bi-directional RNN 

A Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model has been built to translate human readable dates (for e.g: 25/06/2009 or "25th of June, 2009" ) into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25"). This is done using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence to sequence models. 

Requires keras.
